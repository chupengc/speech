model configuration:

self.gru = nn.GRU(input_size, hidden_size, 1)
self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 2)

-------------------------------------------------

detection performance:

hidden size 5
Model test accuracy: 0.323
hidden size 10
Model test accuracy: 0.355
hidden size 50
Model test accuracy: 0.581

-------------------------------------------------

As the number of features in the hidden state increases, we can obeserve an increasing trend 
of accuracy. This could be due to the fact that while we increase the hidden size, we are also 
increasing the complexity of the GRU model, therefore the model has the potential to capture 
more features in the hidden state and make more accurate prediction.
